          <h2>My thoughts on Certifications</h2>

          <p>
            I mostly have AWS Certifications so I can provide my thoughts on
            these certifications and the impacts pursuing them has had on my
            life and career.
          </p>
          <h3>Positives</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            For me personally , obtaining certifications opened a lot of doors
            and provided opportunities within and outside the company I was
            working for at the time. It also helped with networking as it
            develops a sense of community around individuals who have particular
            certifications and others who wish to pursue them. I have developed
            relationships with a lot of people through discussions about
            certifications and the ecosystem surrounded by it such as prep
            material , official documentation , and such.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obtaining certifications helps cover a broad range of material and
            introduces people to technology and their use cases. From my
            experience with AWS certifications - I have a solid grasp of what
            most of the services do and how they interact with each other. This
            has proven to be a valuable skill in teams and individual projects.
            It also proves as a good foundation for products that have to be
            developed using the respective technology. The AWS ecosystem also
            introduced me to several best practices in software engineering such
            as disaster recovery , fault tolerance , scalable architecture,
            security, and several other concepts that carry over into my
            skillset as a software engineer.
          </p>
          <h3>Negatives</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            Certifications provide an abstracted, high-level view of the
            products and solutions. Having a certification on it's own does not
            provide too much inherent value in terms of being a better engineer
            or proving competence in the respective domain. My opinion is that
            an individual with a SysOps Administrator certificate from AWS but
            someone who has no experience as a SysOps Administrator will
            definitely have to spend time learning the fundamentals and
            developing their skillset in order to become a valuable , effective
            SysOps Administrator.
          </p>
          <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            At the end of the day, certifications have to be combined with
            personal projects and relevant work experience and practice to be
            truly effective. Certifications are extremely valuable for opening
            the door to new opportunities and networks and can set individuals
            apart in their respective domain.
