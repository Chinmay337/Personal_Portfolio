      <p>As a kid growing up, I travelled between the United States and India multiple times back and forth.</p>

      I love
      travelling within the United States and going on road trips and
      exploring the local culture.

      When I was in the 10th grade, one of my dreams was to become a professional video gamer. <br /><br />
      Gaming has proven to be a reliable escape for me and has been there during the worst of times,
      so I have a deep love for gaming and competitive esports in general. <br /><br />
      I am a huge fan of Dota2 and have followed the competitive landscape ever since it's inception.
      I believe competitive eSports will grow exponentially in the coming years and attract a lot of
      new people towards it!

      Fitness is important to me and it has instilled important qualities that carry over into all
      aspects of my life such as discipline and patience. <br /><br />
      Working out and doing outdoors activities such as Skiing and Snowboarding provides amazing
      mental relief for me and this is one my favorite things to do to de-stress!<br /><br />
      I love to take care of my mental and physical health as I believe this is very important and
      has a strong effect on quality of life for an individual and the people around them. ðŸ™‚

    <div class="h-text-right">
      <p> I thoroughly enjoy art and design and I would consider myself to be an artistic person. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>I enjoy and appreciate the small details in life and this makes a difference for me. This is why travelling is
        so amazing because we get to experience different kinds of art - natural and human-made.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Art is as close as we can get to timeless beauty - when I was in Italy I was lucky to witness Renaissance Era
        art and it is truly amazing to witness.</p>
