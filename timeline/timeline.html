            Graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a Bachelor's in
            Supply Chain Management. Towards the end of my degree I took a class
            in Supply Chain Analytics using R & Python for Data Science and this
            got me really interested in the world of technology and
            programming.<br />
            I learned Python in a Data Science and Analytics context and got
            hired as an Analytics Analyst working for Accenture Federal
            Services.

            There was a shortage on staff required for the Healthcare.gov
            project, which was the company's largest project - so upon being
            hired I began work as a Business Analyst on
            ObamaCare/Healthcare.gov. <br /><br />
            I am grateful for this experience , as I was exposed to people from
            different teams and different backgrounds and got exposure to the
            entire technology stack. Here, I saw the promise and potential of
            AWS and decided that I wanted to pivot into a technical development
            role as I thoroughly enjoy creating - I always wanted to be a
            developer but I thought this was not possible due to me not pursuing
            a Computer Science degree - upon entering the workforce I understood
            and learned a lot about what being a developer means. I gained
            confidence and decided that is time to begin my journey and take
            things one step at a time.

            I learned AWS and got certified as a Solution Architect and
            transitioned from a Business Analyst to a Junior DevOps Engineer on
            the Cloud Deployment team. <br />I am extremely thankful for this
            opportunity to this day and the team and the manager took a chance
            on me which gave me a foot into the door. In the meanwhile , I
            wanted to learn the fundamentals of Computer Science so I studied
            for entrance exams and started looking at Masters Programs to get
            into.

            I discovered I love learning and have strong time-management skills,
            so I was able to balance my new role with challenging hours and I
            began applying for Masters programs looking to develop myself as a
            strong engineer.<br />
            I loved my new role as I got to learn about the DevOps culture,
            cloud infrastructure , Linux , Git , writing scripts in Python and
            Git Bash , and so many more things I cannot all mention!

            I developed a lot in my role and I started leading overnight
            deployments on my own along with my team members. I kept learning
            about Linux , AWS, and Git and learned how to increase my
            productivity and help others develop on the team as well. I led
            initiatives to explain cloud concepts and Linux best practices to
            several internal teams.

            I started my Masters in Computer Information Systems at Boston
            University. I discovered JS and I absolutely fell in love with it. I
            started creating internal tools to solve simple problems the teams
            were facing using JS. <br />
            I always wanted to make applications and I realized I wanted to get
            better at JS and I started to learn about Web App development.
            <br />I wanted to develop on my knowledge of AWS , so I further got
            additional certifications and practiced making projects
            incorporating my AWS knowledge.

            My passion for Development , Cloud Technology , DevOps, and software
            in general led me to get a job as a Full Stack Developer for
            Infinitive - a mid-sized commercial technology consulting
            company.<br />
            I wanted to pivot out of the federal sector and fully utilize modern
            tooling and technology - so this was a great decision for me.
            <br />I am currently here, working as a Lead DevOps Engineer leading
            a team of 6 engineers at Capital One and working on creating
            application prototypes for the Market Development team.

            In my first 6 months, I set up my entire team and onboarded and
            taught the engineers the tasks at hand.<br />
            I created a Full Stack application utilizing various new AWS machine
            learning and AI services which is outlined in the project section.
            <br />
            On the side this entire time, I kept learning about things I was
            passionate about - such as JS (React/Redux/Node) , AWS , and Data
            Structures and Algorithms. I decided to minor in Web Application
            Development for my Masters program.

            team and responsibilities. I am learning about distributed

            when building an application. My goal is to work as a Software
            Developer / Software Engineer and I am excited to have more time
            available once my degree is finished to focus fully on being an
